Requirements

dell_disable_vil7: True

disable_vil7 - This means OMSA won't load the dsm_sm_psrvil library - this disables NVMe detection by OMSA but it also makes all the omreport commands work on CentOS7.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

      roles:
         - { role: ansible-role-dell }
